Instructions:

   The goal is to prevent any frog from reaching the other side of the road.
   Each frog reaching the top will decrease your life gauge (top left).
   When your life gauge is entirely empty, a game over screen will appear (
     sweep your finger on the screen to begin anew)
   You must generate traffic on the road to squish all the frogs. You win when
   the timer reach 0 and you are still alive. 

Controls:
   Sweep : touch down with your finger and move it on the screen, maintaining
      contact along the way. Touching the cars on the left and dragging them
      at various speed will fling them on the road, to your benefit.
   Touch down:
      Simply press certain objects on the screen (Barrels will react 
      like a vehicule, but will explode when pressed.)
   

Tips:
   1. Barrels of TNT will only explode when pressed when at least at a short
      distance from the left and right of the screen.
   2. Motorcycles and Trucks have a different weight than other vehicules. Use
      it to your advantage
   3. You can fling a car that is already in motion. Is it worth the trouble?
      Your call!
   4. Cars prefer to stay in their respective lane, but you have the final say.
      Watch out for frontal collisions.

No frogs were harmed during the making of this game.
